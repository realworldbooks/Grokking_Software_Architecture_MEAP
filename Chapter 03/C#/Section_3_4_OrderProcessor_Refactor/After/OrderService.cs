/// ARCHITECTURE NOTE: Look closely at this class. Notice what it DOESN'T do:
/// It doesn't validate, it doesn't charge credit cards, and it doesn't send emails. 
/// 
/// Instead, it acts as a high-level "Coordinator". It orchestrates the flow of 
/// the transaction by delegating the actual work to the injected services. 
/// 
/// By using Constructor Injection (DIP), we can easily pass in "Mock" versions 
/// of the PaymentService and NotificationService to completely unit test this 
/// entire checkout flow in milliseconds without ever hitting a real database 
/// or charging a real credit card!
