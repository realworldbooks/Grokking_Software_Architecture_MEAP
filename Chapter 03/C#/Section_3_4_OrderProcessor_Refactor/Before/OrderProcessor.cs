/// <summary>
/// ANTI-PATTERN: The "God Class" / Monolithic Transaction Script.
/// 
/// ARCHITECTURE PROBLEM: This class is a massive violation of the Single 
/// Responsibility Principle (SRP) and is tightly coupled to four distinct domains.
/// 
/// If this were a real enterprise application, this one method would:
/// 1. Contain complex business validation rules.
/// 2. Talk to a third-party Payment Gateway API (like Stripe).
/// 3. Connect to a SQL Database to update inventory tables.
/// 4. Talk to a third-party Email API (like SendGrid).
/// 
/// WHY THIS FAILS:
/// - Testing: You cannot test the validation logic without accidentally triggering 
///   real payment calls or database updates.
/// - Maintenance: Four different teams (Billing, Inventory, Communications, Sales) 
///   will constantly be modifying this exact same file, causing merge conflicts.
/// - Brittleness: A timeout error from the Email API could cause the entire 
///   payment process to roll back or crash!
