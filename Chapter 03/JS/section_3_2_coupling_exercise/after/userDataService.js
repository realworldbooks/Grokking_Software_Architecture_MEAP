/**
 * THE SOLUTION: The "Chunky" API and High Cohesion.
 * * ARCHITECTURE NOTE: The service has taken back its rightful responsibilities!
 * Instead of forcing the client to orchestrate the data gathering, the service 
 * now does the heavy lifting internally. 
 * * By exposing a single, coarse-grained ("chunky") method that returns a plain 
 * JavaScript object (acting as our Data Transfer Object), we eliminate the 
 * Chatty API problem. This minimizes potential network round-trips and completely 
 * encapsulates the internal complexity of how an order total is calculated.
