 * THE SOLUTION: The Loosely Coupled Client.

 * It no longer suffers from "Feature Envy"—it doesn't have to loop through 
 * orders, request individual totals, or perform its own math.
 * * It simply asks the service for the completed report data and formats it. 
 * If the underlying database schema or the way a "totalSpent" is calculated 
 * changes, this client class will not require a single line of code to be modified.
