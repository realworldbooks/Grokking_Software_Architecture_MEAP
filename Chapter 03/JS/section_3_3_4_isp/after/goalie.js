/**
 * INTERFACE COMPOSITION (The Goalie "Opt-In").
 * * ARCHITECTURE NOTE: The beauty of Interface Segregation is that classes 
 * can "opt-in" to the specific behaviors they need. Since a Goalie needs 
 * both field skills (kicking/tackling) and specialized net skills, it 
 * simply implements both conceptual roles. 
 * * We have accommodated the complex requirements of the Goalie without 
 * polluting the Midfielder's codebase with irrelevant methods!
