/**
 * ANTI-PATTERN: The "Fat Interface" (ISP Violation).
 * * ARCHITECTURE PROBLEM: The Interface Segregation Principle dictates that 
 * no client should be forced to depend on methods it does not use. 
 * * In this "Before" state, the Midfielder is conceptually tied to a bloated 
 * definition of a "Player." Because the system expects every player to 
 * handle every type of training, the Midfielder is forced to carry 
 * around Goalie-specific logic. 
 * * WHY THIS FAILS:
 * - Fragility: Other parts of the system might see these methods and 
 * blindly call them, leading to runtime crashes.
 * - Code Rot: We are forced to write "dummy" implementations that only 
 * exist to throw errors, cluttering the class and confusing developers.
