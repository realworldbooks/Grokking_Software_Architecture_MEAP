/**
 * DIP SOLUTION: Constructor Injection and Loose Coupling.
 * * ARCHITECTURE NOTE: The Coach is no longer responsible for building its own 
 * team. The 'new' keyword and hardcoded 'requires' have been completely removed!
 * * Instead, the Coach receives its dependencies as an argument. This is 
 * "Dependency Injection." Because the Coach only expects an array of objects 
 * with a .performAction() method, we can hand it any combination of players.
 * * This makes the Coach class infinitely extensible and trivial to unit test 
 * using mock player objects.
