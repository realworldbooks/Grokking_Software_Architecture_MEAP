/**
 * ANTI-PATTERN: Violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
 * * ARCHITECTURE PROBLEM: High-level modules (Coach) should not depend on 
 * low-level modules (Forward/Midfielder). Both should depend on abstractions.
 * * By using 'require' and 'new' inside this class, the Coach is now 
 * "hard-wired" to these specific players. 
 * * WHY THIS FAILS:
 * - Rigid: You cannot swap a Forward for a Winger without editing the Coach file.
 * - Untestable: You cannot unit test the Coach without also creating real 
 * instances of the players. You are stuck with whatever is in those files.
