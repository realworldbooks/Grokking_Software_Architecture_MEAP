 * Instead of forcing the client to orchestrate the data gathering, the service 
 * now does the heavy lifting internally. 
 * * By exposing a single, coarse-grained ("chunky") method, we eliminate the 
 * Chatty API problem, minimizing potential network round-trips and completely 
 * encapsulating the internal complexity of how an order total is calculated.
