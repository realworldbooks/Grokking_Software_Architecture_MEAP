 * ANTI-PATTERN: The "Chatty" API and Tight Coupling.

 * sequential calls to assemble a complete picture of a User.
 * * If this were a remote microservice or a network boundary, every single 
 * method call would incur latency. Furthermore, the client is forced to know 
 * too much about how to piece this data together.
