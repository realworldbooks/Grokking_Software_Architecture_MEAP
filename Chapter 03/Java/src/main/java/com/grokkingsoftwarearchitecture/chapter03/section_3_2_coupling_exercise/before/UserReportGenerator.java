/**
 * ANTI-PATTERN: The Tightly Coupled Client.
 * * ARCHITECTURE PROBLEM: Because the UserDataService is too granular, this client 
 * class is forced to take on the responsibility of orchestrating the data gathering. 
 * * The generator now knows WAY too much about the internal structure of the data. 
 * It knows that it has to fetch the user, then fetch the orders, and then loop 
 * through the orders to calculate a total. This is a severe violation of encapsulation.
