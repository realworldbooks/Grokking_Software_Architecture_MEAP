 * ANTI-PATTERN: Violation of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP).

 * "Open for extension, but Closed for modification." 
 * * Right now, this class is heavily modified every time requirements change. If 
 * the team learns a new play (like "PassToStriker"), we are FORCED to open this 
 * file, modify the Midfielder class, and add another 'else if' block. 
 * * This means every new feature requires altering existing, already-tested code, 
 * which dramatically increases the risk of introducing regressions or bugs.
