 * * Notice what is MISSING here: There are no "if (fieldPlayer instanceof Goalie)" checks. 
 * There are no try/catch blocks expecting an UnsupportedOperationException. The Coach 
 * trusts the abstraction 100%. If an object is passed in as a Player, the Coach 
 * knows for a fact it can play the field.
