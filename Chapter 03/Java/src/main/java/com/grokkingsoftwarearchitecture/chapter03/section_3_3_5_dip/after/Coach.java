/**
 * DIP SOLUTION: Constructor Injection and Loose Coupling.
 * * ARCHITECTURE NOTE: The Coach is no longer responsible for building its own 
 * team. The 'new' keyword has been completely removed! 
 * * Instead, the Coach asks for its dependencies through its constructor. This 
 * is called "Dependency Injection." Because the Coach only asks for a list 
 * of 'Player' abstractions, we can hand it literally any combination of players. 
 * * This makes the Coach class infinitely extensible and incredibly easy to unit 
 * test (we can just pass in "Mock" players during testing without spinning up 
 * concrete classes).
