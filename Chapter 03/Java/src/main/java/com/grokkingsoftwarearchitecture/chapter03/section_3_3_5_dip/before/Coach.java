/**
 * ANTI-PATTERN: Violation of the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP).
 * * ARCHITECTURE PROBLEM: The Dependency Inversion Principle states that 
 * high-level modules (like this Coach) should not depend on low-level 
 * modules (like the concrete Forward and Midfielder classes). Both should 
 * depend on abstractions.
 * * Here, the Coach is tightly coupled to specific classes. By using the 
 * 'new' keyword inside the constructor, the Coach is permanently welded 
 * to these exact implementations. If we want to test the Coach in isolation, 
 * or if we want to sub in a different type of Forward (like a substitute), 
 * we are completely blocked. We have to rip open the Coach class to make changes.
