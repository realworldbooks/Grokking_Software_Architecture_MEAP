Responsibility 1: Player State and Core Actions.
* ARCHITECTURE NOTE: By stripping away infrastructure and AI logic, the Player 
class has become a "Pure Domain Model." It is now highly cohesive, meaning 
every line of code inside this class relates directly to what a player IS. 
* This is now an "Anemic-friendly" or "Rich" model that can be easily 
serialized, moved across network boundaries, or used in different game 
modes without dragging along a database connection.
