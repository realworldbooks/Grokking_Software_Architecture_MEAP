Responsibility 2: Tactical / AI Logic.
* ARCHITECTURE NOTE: This class is a "Service." By moving tactical decisions 
here, we've decoupled the 'Intelligence' of the game from the 'Actor' (the Player). 
* In Python, this allows you to easily swap out this engine for a different 
version—perhaps one driven by Machine Learning or a simple rule-based system—
without ever needing to modify the Player class itself.
