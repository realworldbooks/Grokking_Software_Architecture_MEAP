"""
ANTI-PATTERN: The "God Class" (SRP Violation).

ARCHITECTURE PROBLEM: This class is doing way too much. According to the 
Single Responsibility Principle, a class should have only ONE reason to change. 

This Python implementation currently has three distinct reasons:
1. Domain Logic: If the physical rules of how a player dribbles change.
2. Tactical Logic: If the AI algorithm for positioning is updated.
3. Persistence Logic: If the database schema or the way we save data changes.

In a professional Python environment, this makes unit testing a nightmare 
because you cannot test a simple 'dribble' without the class carrying around 
unused (and potentially broken) database code.
