OCP SOLUTION: Closed for Modification.
* ARCHITECTURE NOTE: Look at the simplicity here! The massive if/elif chain 
is completely gone. The Midfielder no longer decides HOW a play works; 
it simply tells the play to execute itself. 
* This class is now "Closed for Modification"—we can add 100 new plays to 
the playbook and we will never have to touch this file again.
