"""
ANTI-PATTERN: Violation of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP).

ARCHITECTURE PROBLEM: The Open/Closed Principle states that a class should be 
"Open for extension, but Closed for modification." 

In this Python implementation, the Midfielder class is NOT closed for 
modification. Every time the team learns a new play (like 'PassToStriker'), 
we are forced to open this file and add a new 'elif' block. 

WHY THIS IS DANGEROUS:
- Regression Risk: Every time you touch this file to add a feature, you risk 
  breaking the existing plays (Dribble or Defensive).
- Maintenance Burden: As the playbook grows, this single method will become 
  a massive, unreadable "if/elif" monster.
- Rigid Design: The Midfielder is tightly coupled to specific string names, 
  making it difficult to swap or share plays across different player types.
