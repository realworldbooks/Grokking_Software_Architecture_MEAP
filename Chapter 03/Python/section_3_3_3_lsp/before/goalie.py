ANTI-PATTERN: Violation of the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP).
* ARCHITECTURE PROBLEM: LSP states that objects of a superclass should 
be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the 
application logic.
* Here, the Goalie inherits from Player but provides "surprising" 
behavior. It technically implements the method, but it refuses to 
perform the actual work promised by the base class.
