INTERFACE COMPOSITION.
* ARCHITECTURE NOTE: Python handles ISP beautifully through multiple 
inheritance. Because a Goalie needs both general field skills and 
specialized net skills, we simply compose the Goalie out of both 
interfaces. 
* This provides total flexibility without polluting the base definitions 
for other players.
