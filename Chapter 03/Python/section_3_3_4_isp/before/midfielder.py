ANTI-PATTERN: The Incomplete Implementation.
* ARCHITECTURE PROBLEM: Because Midfielder inherits from TrainingSession, 
it MUST implement all four methods to be instantiated.
* This results in "Code Rot." We are forced to provide dummy implementations 
that throw errors, cluttering our domain model with logic that shouldn't 
exist here in the first place.
