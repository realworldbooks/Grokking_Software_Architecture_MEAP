DIP SOLUTION: Dependency Injection.
* ARCHITECTURE NOTE: The 'Coach' is now completely decoupled from specific 
player types. It no longer 'imports' Forward or Midfielder. 
* By accepting a list of players in the constructor, we have moved the 
responsibility of team assembly (The Composition Root) outside of this class. 
The Coach is now a pure coordinator that works with any object following 
the Player contract.
