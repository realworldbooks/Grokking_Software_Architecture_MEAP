"""
ANTI-PATTERN: The "God Class" / Monolithic Script.
* ARCHITECTURE PROBLEM: This class is the "Everything Hub." It violates 
the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) by managing four distinct 
responsibilities:
1. Validation Logic
2. Payment Gateway Integration
3. Inventory State Management
4. Notification / Communication Logic

WHY THIS IS BRITTLE:
- Hard to Test: You can't test if the validation logic works without 
  triggering print statements for payments and emails.
- High Coupling: If you switch from Email to SMS notifications, you have 
  to modify this core business processing file.
- Fragile: A failure in the "Notify" step could theoretically crash 
  the entire order process if not handled correctly.
