    /// Azure uses "Bindings" to abstract away the network plumbing, but it 
    /// "Owns" your method signature in exchange for that convenience.
    /// 
    /// TEACHING NOTE:
    /// Look at the 'Stream myBlob' parameter. Unlike the AWS example, we don't 
    /// receive a JSON event; we receive the actual file content! Azure's host 
    /// process performed the download for us before our code even started. 
    /// While this is "cleaner," notice the trade-off: this method signature 
    /// is now proprietary to the Azure Functions runtime. The infrastructure 
    /// has "Leaked" into our method arguments, making it difficult to run 
    /// this code anywhere else without a wrapper.
    /// </summary>

        // 2. THE LOGIC:
        log.LogInformation($"      [Azure Function] Processing image resize...");
