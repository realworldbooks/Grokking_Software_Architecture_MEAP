/// 
/// DESIGN NOTE:
/// This record simulates the proprietary, strongly-typed object tree provided by the 
/// 'Amazon.Lambda.S3Events' NuGet package, but modeled as a Reactive Stream.
/// 
/// ARCHITECTURAL CRITIQUE:
/// In a reactive architecture, we treat cloud triggers as an infinite stream of incoming 
/// telemetry. However, notice the deep nesting required to find a simple filename: 
/// Records[0].S3.Object.Key. This is a textbook "Abstraction Leak." By forcing your 
/// business logic to navigate this specific hierarchy, the vendor has effectively 
/// "leaked" their internal data model into your application code. Your resizer logic 
/// is no longer a pure function; it is a downstream dependent of Amazon's design.
