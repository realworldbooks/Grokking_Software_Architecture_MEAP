/// This class simulates a standard HTTP Request object (the kind you would find 
/// in ASP.NET Core). By wrapping the payload here, we demonstrate that 
/// Webhooks interact with your application logic using the "Language of the Web" 
/// (HTTP/JSON) rather than "Vendor-Specific Dialects." This makes the 
/// entry point into your system much more predictable and easier to test.

    /// ARCHITECTURAL NOTE:
    /// Modeling the request body as a stream allows our logic to handle

    /// as a stream to maintain a consistent 'Reactive Pipeline' across 
    /// all our cloud implementations.
