     * "fetch" data; it "receives" data. However, notice how the platform 
     * "Owns" your function's signature.
     *
     * @param context - The proprietary mock Azure context.
     * @return An Observable emitting the result of the cloud operation.

             * to a manual SDK call because the data is already here as an 
             * InputStream. But look at the dependency: we are locked into 
             * the 'MockAzureContext'. This "Platform Contamination" makes 
             * it impossible to test this reactive pipe in isolation without 
             * mocking the entire Azure runtime environment. The infrastructure 
             * has leaked into the very heart of the stream logic.
