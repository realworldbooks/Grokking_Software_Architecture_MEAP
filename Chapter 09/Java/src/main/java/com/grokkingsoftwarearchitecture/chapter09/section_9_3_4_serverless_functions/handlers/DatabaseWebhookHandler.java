     * CLOUD 3: DATABASE WEBHOOKS (The Reactive Web Standard)
     *
     * THE ARCHITECTURAL LESSON: 
     * Standardization is the ultimate form of decoupling. By wrapping standard 
     * HTTP triggers in Observables, we create a pipeline that is 100% portable.
     *
     * TEACHING NOTE:
     * Look at the signature. Zero references to 'AWS' or 'Azure'. This logic 
     * is "Standard-Fluent." It observes a request body stream and projects 
     * a result. This represents the pinnacle of the Compute Spectrum because 
     * the host has become an invisible detail. This code can run in a Lambda, 
     * a K8s container, or on a local developer machine with zero changes to 
     * the reactive pipeline.
