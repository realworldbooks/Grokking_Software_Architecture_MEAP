/**
 * THE FRAGILE IMPLEMENTATION:
 * * @description
 * This class represents the "Naive" way of handling external dependencies in Node.js. 
 * It treats a remote network call as if it were a reliable, local constant.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL CRITIQUE:
 * 1. EVENT LOOP BLOCKING: While 'fetch' is asynchronous, the lack of a timeout 
 * means this Promise could remain pending indefinitely. In Node.js, enough 
 * "hanging" requests will eventually exhaust memory and degrade the 
 * responsiveness of the entire event loop.
 * * 2. ABSTRACTION LEAK: There is no Port (Interface). The business logic is forced 
 * to depend directly on this concrete implementation, violating the 
 * Downward Dependency Rule (Chapter 4).
 * * 3. THE HAPPY PATH FALLACY: The code assumes the network is a "Perfect Pipe." 
 * It provides no mechanism to survive a 503 (Service Unavailable) or a 
 * temporary network "blink." Failure here is absolute and results in a 
 * crashed transaction.
