/**
 * THE DEMO COMPOSER:
 * * @description
 * This file serves as the "Composition Root." In a production system, this 
 * role might be handled by a Dependency Injection framework, but doing it 
 * manually here makes the Hexagonal boundaries visible.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL CRITIQUE:
 * Notice that we import the concrete Adapters here at the edge. We then 
 * "Plug" them into the Orchestrator. The Orchestrator itself only knows 
 * about the Ports (Interfaces), which is why it can survive a total 
 * infrastructure swap with zero code changes to the Core.
