/**
 * THE FRAGILE DEMO COMPOSER:
 * * DESIGN NOTE:
 * This file represents the "Junior Developer" entry point. It demonstrates 
 * the 'Happy Path Fallacy' in action—where we assume the outside world 
 * will always behave.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL CRITIQUE:
 * 1. TIGHT COUPLING: Notice that this file must instantiate the concrete 
 * 'FragilePaymentService' directly. There is no Port/Interface to hide behind. 
 * Changing vendors requires a surgical strike on this file.
 * * 2. CASCADING FAILURE: Because the fragile service lacks retries or 
 * internal timeouts, a single "hiccup" in the FlakyPayments API causes an 
 * unhandled exception that explodes here, potentially killing the 
 * entire JVM thread pool.
 * * 3. DATA LOSS: There is no 'Plan B'. If the charge fails, the transaction 
 * is simply forgotten. In a professional system, this is a loss of 
 * revenue and customer trust.
