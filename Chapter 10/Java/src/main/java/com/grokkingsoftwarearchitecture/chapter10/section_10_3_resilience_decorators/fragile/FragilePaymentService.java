/**
 * THE FRAGILE IMPLEMENTATION:
 * * DESIGN NOTE:
 * This class represents the "Naive" way of handling external dependencies in Java. 
 * It treats a remote network call as if it were a local, reliable method call.
 *
 * ARCHITECTURAL CRITIQUE:
 * 1. TEMPORAL COUPLING: This method is "Locked" to the network. Without a timeout 
 * or retry policy, the calling thread is held hostage by FlakyPayments's server. If the
 * network hangs, this thread is essentially dead until the OS kills it.
 * * 2. ABSTRACTION LEAK: There is no Interface (Port). The business logic is forced 
 * to depend directly on this concrete implementation and the 'java.net.http' 
 * library, violating the Downward Dependency Rule (Chapter 4).
 * * 3. THE HAPPY PATH FALLACY: The code assumes that if it sends a request, it 
 * receives a success. It provides no mechanism to survive a 503 (Service 
 * Unavailable) or a temporary network blip. Failure here is absolute and total.
